VERSION OF UNITY USED: 2021.2.6f1

DESCRIPTION:
These are scripts from a Chao garden project I've been working on in Unity. I haven't included the Chao model because I didn't create the one used in my project and don't want to release it without the original creator's consent.

You can use these for anything you like, if you do use them, or need help setting them up in a Unity project, feel free to DM me! I'm on Chao Island's Discord and can be contacted there. I strongly recommend you use the same version of Unity that I did, because older/newer versions might not be compatible with the scripts.

Have fun!
